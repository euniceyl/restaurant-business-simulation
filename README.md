# Restaurant Business Simulation

A probabilistic modeling project of a hypothetical new restaurant opening, with the primary aim of optimizing customer satisfaction and profit depending on the number of chefs hired and duration of down-time allocation during the working day.

Scenario 1:
Consider the simple setting with one dining table and one chef, with operating hours 10am - 10pm. Suppose customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of 位<sub>A</sub> = 5 per hour. Once a customer arrives, their total service time (ordering, cooking and eating) can be modeled by an exponential distribution with rate 位<sub>S</sub> = 6.

Scenario 2:
Consider the setting with 5 dining tables and L chefs, with operating hours 10am - 10pm. Suppose customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of 位<sub>A</sub> = 10 per hour. Once a customer arrives, their total service time can be modeled by an exponential distribution with rate 位<sub>S</sub> = 3L. Assume a customer spends $50 per meal, and each chef earns a wage of $40 per hour.
